# LLM Benchmarking Project (Bun)

This repository contains a benchmarking suite designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). It runs a series of tests across various tasks and metrics to produce a set of scores for a given LLM model.  The project is built using Bun, a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a standardized and reproducible way to benchmark LLMs.  It includes:

*   **A collection of test cases:** These cover a range of tasks like question answering, text generation, code completion, and more.
*   **Metrics calculation:**  The project automatically calculates relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, perplexity, BLEU score) based on the test results.
*   **Reproducibility:**  The benchmarking process is designed to be reproducible, allowing for consistent comparisons between different models.

## Prerequisites

*   **Bun:**  You need Bun installed on your system. You can download it from [https://bun.sh/](https://bun.sh/).  Make sure you have a recent version (v1.0 or later).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd <your_repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun i
    ```
    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

## Running the Benchmarks

To run the benchmarking suite, use the following command:

```bash
bun start
